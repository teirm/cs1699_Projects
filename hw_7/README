README
------
This is a readme for assignment 7.

To Run:
        hive -hiveconf hive.metastore.warehouse.dir=/user/<your_warehouse_path> -f hw_7.hql

Requires:
    python2
    cutload.py

The data directory is hardcorded in the hql script and 'input/' should be at the same level
as the hql script in the directory tree.  Please make any necessary chances you see fit.

The output is in 'out.txt'.  This contains the results of the final query, and not the
HADOOP output.  All the output from the command is in 'hadoop.out'.
